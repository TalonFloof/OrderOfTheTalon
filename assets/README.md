# Why are there only some assets here?

Minecraft's assets are copyrighted by Mojang Studios. To respect this, only modified assets are included here. Any unmodified ones are required to be provided with a copy of the Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 JAR from Mojang's servers.
Textures uses in `terrain.png` and `gui/items.png` use Jappa's textures. Usage of these textures ~~should~~ fall under fair use within US Copyright Laws.
